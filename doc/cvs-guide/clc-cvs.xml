    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This text is a HOWTO for CLC maintainers. It describes how to add
      ports to the CVS first and to <filename>clc/stable</filename> or
      <filename>clc/unstable</filename> afterwards.
    </para>
    <para>
      It assumes you know <command>cvs</command> already (or have its
      documentation somewhere); you should also have read <ulink
      url="http://rfhs8012.fh-regensburg.de/~opel/crux/clc/">this
	document</ulink> describing how the CVS at CLC is structured.
    </para>
    <para>
      Feedback and suggestions are very much appreciated.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Getting ready</title>
    <sect2>
      <title>Before you start</title>
      <para>
	The CVS at CLC is accessed via <command>ssh</command>, therefore
	you have to make sure that the <literal>CVS_RSH</literal> is set
	correctly (in most cases, it should
	be set to <literal>ssh</literal>) (consult the CVS documentation for
	more information about this).
      </para>
      <para>
	You can specify default arguments <command>cvs</command> uses in
	your <filename>~/.cvsrc</filename> file; the following settings are
	highly recommended:
      </para>
      <programlisting>update -d -P
diff -u</programlisting>
      <para>
	See the man page of <command>cvs</command> for more information
	about the <filename>.cvsrc</filename> file.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Initial checkout</title>
      <para>
	First of all, you need to check out the CVS tree from CLC. You can
	do this where ever you want to, but in this example, I'll use
	<filename>$HOME/crux/cvs</filename> for this.
      </para>
      <programlisting>cd $HOME/crux/cvs
cvs -d<replaceable>username</replaceable>@crux.fh-regensburg.de:/home/crux/cvs checkout clc</programlisting>
      <para>
	Of course you will have to replace
	<replaceable>username</replaceable> with your login
	name. Afterwards, you'll have a directory called
	<filename>clc</filename> containing all the ports already in cvs.
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1>
    <title>Adding a new port to CVS</title>
    <para>
      Let's assume you made a port of the imaginary package called
      <filename>freedom</filename>. You are sure it's ready to go into
      CVS.
    </para>
    <para>
      While it doesn't matter where you made your port, let's
      assume from now on that you did this in
      <filename>$HOME/build</filename>. Therefore, your port resists
      in <filename>$HOME/build/freedom</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
      To add it, use the following commands:
    </para>
    <programlisting>cd $HOME/crux/cvs/clc
cp -r $HOME/build/freedom .
cvs add freedom
cd freedom
cvs add Pkgfile .footprint .md5sum
cvs commit -m "Initial release of freedom"</programlisting>
    <para>
      In case you have patches or a README file, make sure you add them
      as well. <emphasis>Don't add the files which will be
      downloaded!</emphasis>. Please include the name of the port in the
      commit message as this messages are listed on the <ulink href="http://crux.fh-regensburg.de/cgi-bin/cvstrac/timeline">timeline
      page</ulink>
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Adding a port to a collection (contrib/unmaintained)</title>
    <para>
      To add a port to either <filename>contrib</filename> or
      <filename>unmaintained</filename>, tags are used. The tags for
      contrib are
      <literal>CONTRIB-$VERSION</literal> where $VERSION is the version
      of the CRUX release this port was made for, e.g.
      <literal>CONTRIB-1_2</literal>. Note that dots in the version
      become underscores.
      To add it to <filename>contrib</filename> do the following
      (assuming you are in <filename>$HOME/crux/cvs/clc/</filename>):
    </para>
    <programlisting>cd freedom
cvs tag CONTRIB-1_2</programlisting>
    <para>
      Ports which have no maintainer within the CLC team should be
      tagged <literal>UNMAINTAINED</literal>.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Updating a port</title>
    <para>
    </para>
    <para>
      If you make changes to the port, all you have to do is commit your
      changes and move the tag to make it (the tag) point to the latest
      revision of the files.
    </para>
    <programlisting>cd $HOME/crux/cvs/clc/freedom
(make some changes)
cvs commit -m "<replaceable>description of the change, including name of port"</replaceable>
cvs tag -c -F CONTRIB-1_2</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>-F</literal> switch tells <command>cvs</command> to
      move the tag if it was already given to an earlier
      revision.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Changing the collection</title>
    <para>
      If you want to move a port from <filename>clc/unstable</filename>
      to <filename>clc/stable</filename> (or the other way around), all
      you have to do is delete the old tag and set the new one. If you
      forget to delete the old tag, the port will appear in both
      <filename>unmaintained</filename> and
      <filename>contrib</filename>.
    </para>
    <programlisting>cd $HOME/crux/cvs/clc/freedom
cvs tag -d UNMAINTAINED
cvs tag -c -F CONTRIB-1_2</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>-d</literal> switch tells <command>cvs</command> to
      delete the specified tag.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Removing a port</title>
    <para>
      There are two levels of removing a ports: removing it from the
      collections (<filename>clc/unstable</filename>, 
      <filename>clc/stable</filename>) or removing it from the CVS
      repository.
    </para>
    <para>
      To remove it from the collections, all you have to do
      it remove the tag (assuming it is in <filename>clc/stable</filename>):
    </para>
    <programlisting>cd $HOME/crux/cvs/clc/freedom
cvs tag -d CONTRIB-1_2</programlisting>
    <para>
      To remove it from CVS completely, make sure you delete the tags
      first, then call <command>cvs delete</command> for the port
      directory you want to remove and finally call cvs update with the
      <literal>-P</literal> switch to remove the empty directory.
    </para>
    <programlisting>cd $HOME/crux/cvs/clc/freedom
cvs tag -d CONTRIB-1_2
cvs delete -R -f freedom
cvs update -P
</programlisting>
  </sect1>
